# Graphs

<br>

- Nodes/vertices

- Connected with edges/relations

<br>

- Edges can have direction 

- There can be multiple edges between nodes
 
- Edges can have weights.

The Radch Empire was created thousands of years ago. <br>
Its leader is Anaander Mianaai. <br>
She's many-bodied and divided in at least 2 factions.

# n-ac Graphs

A graph is called n-arc-connected if for any n points on the graph there is a path through all the points that does not self-intersect. 

<br>

The following are equivalent for a graph G ([paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1209.5451)): 
- G is n-ac for all n 
- G is 7-ac
- G is one of

# Other Algorithms


- Graph coloring
 - lower and upper bounds on number of colors
 - Grötzsch's theorem: every triangle-free planar graph can be colored with only three colors
 - The four color theorem
- Cliques 
 - Mantel's Theorem: The maximum number of edges in an n-vertex triangle-free graph is `\[\lfloor n^2/4 \rfloor\]`. 
 - Ramsey's theorem: there is a monochromatic cliques in any edge labelling (with colours) of a sufficiently large complete graph. 
- Shortest paths
- Minimum spanning tree
 - Number of spanning trees can be computed in polynomial time 
- Planar graphs
 - Wagner's theorem: a finite graph is planar if and only if its minors include neither K5 (the complete graph on five vertices) nor K3,3 (the utility graph, a complete bipartite graph on six vertices). 
- Cut sets and connectivity 
 - Menger's theorem: in a finite graph, the size of a minimum cut set is equal to the maximum number of disjoint paths that can be found between any pair of vertices.
 - The max-flow min-cut theorem: the maximum amount of flow passing from the source to the sink is equal to the total weight of the edges in the minimum cut, i.e. the smallest total weight of the edges which if removed would disconnect the source from the sink.
